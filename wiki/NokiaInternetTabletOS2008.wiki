= How to build a package =

In a standard python distribution you can just run (tested on Ubuntu, Cygwin and OS2008):
{{{
$ python -O tools/deb.py [ <version> ]
}}}
it assumes that you are in the source directory and will create `fitness_<version>_all.deb` in the current directory. The optional _version_ parameter will set the version string to its value; if it is not specified, the environment variable `FITNESS_VERSION` will be used; if it is not defined, the subversion revision number will be used to make the version: `1.<revision>`.
