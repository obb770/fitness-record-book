The fitness record book implementation on Nokia's Internet Tablet device runs on OS2008 and is written in Python.

= How to build a package =

In a standard python distribution you can just run (hopefully this will run on the device too - tested on Ubuntu and Cygwin):
{{{
$ python deb.py
}}}
it assumes that you are in the source directory and will create `fitness_<version>_all.deb` in the current directory.

Then you copy the file to the Nokia and from the application manager select `Application->Install` from `file...` then select the .deb file that you copied.

You should see the program in the Task Navigator under `Extras`

You should be able to uninstall from the application manager

The saved data is written under `/home/user/.fitness` (see `fitness` file - no .py, for the code that creates the directory and chdir there).
